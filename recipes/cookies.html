    <p>Dad's Favorite Peanut Butter Cookies</p>    

    <p>My dad's sister gave me this recipe for killer peanut butter cookies made with shortening.</p>

    <p>Couldn't quit eating them!! Making another batch this week!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup shortening</li>
        <li>½ cup crunchy peanut butter</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cream shortening, peanut butter, and both sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in egg until incorporated. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; gradually stir into peanut butter mixture until combined. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Roll chilled dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Flatten dough balls with a fork dipped in flour to form a crosswise pattern.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
